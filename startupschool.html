	<h1>Krister's Startup School</h1>
	<h3>Idea</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Your idea sucks. Ask around.</li>
		<li>Keeping your idea to yourself keeps you blind. Take off your blinders. If someone is going to copy your
			idea, good for you - it was going to be copied anyway you saved yourself some time.</li>
		<li>Your idea has been thought of thousands of times around the world. Hundreds have attempted to execute it.
			Find out why others failed, learn from their mistakes. Talk to failed entrapeneurs.</li>
		<li>Always put your idea into a form like The Lean Canvas to understand the business side.</li>
		<li>Every idea is always good with a million people using it. Question is how to get the first 1000 users.</li>
		<li>How good your idea is can be measured in how painful it is to people and how willing are they to pay you for
			a solution.</li>
		<li>What the solution is doesn't even matter before you've validate that the problem is indeed worth fixing in
			the first place.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Pre-Execution</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>The MUST READ books are a <b>The Lean Startup</b>, <b>4 Hour Work Week</b>, <b>The Personal MBA</b> and
			<b>Running Lean</b>. If you're only going to read one get Running Lean. In fact <a
				href="https://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172" targer="_blank">order it
				right now</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sobxOzRjAGg" target="_blank">watch the
				summaries</a> of the other ones while you wait for it to arrive.</li>
		<li>Also read what seems interesting in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul
				Grahams Essays</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Do not build your product yet! Go talk to your customer one-on-one first. Get 10 of them to give you
				money. If it's emails you're collecting you need at least 100x more.</b> If you know exactly what the
			product will look like you've already gone too far. Perhaps you're imagining your app being used by
			thousands of people? It's such a large cake and all I want is a small piece - can't be that hard, right? The
			only real important thing is how do you get the first 100 people to actively use your product once it
			reaches the MVP stage. This means focusing hard on only one super specific solution and getting that to
			work. "The platform is so powerful there are so many ways to make this work" doesn't cut it. Hearing a
			starting entrapeneur say this makes me cringe, because I thought like that once and it's just not how things
			work. You'll likely spend two months building something and abandoning it not because the project isn't
			interesting, but that nobody is using it.</li>
		<li>In fact <b>don't start coding until a client is trying to pay you</b>. Any entrapeneur will have dozens of
			ideas floating around their head at any time. The only real way to choose your next project is by validating
			all of them (read Running Lean). The validation phase is ripe when there is money on the table.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Execution</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Don't think of a solution, think of all the solutions and a way to measure which pieces actually work.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Team building principles</h3>
	<p><i>Disclaimer: Most of these ideas are not tested. Each team is different. Take with a bucket of salt.</i></p>
	<iframe width="700" height="300" src="http://104.248.243.132/widget?organisatsioon=Elron"></iframe>
	<ol>
		<li>Never divide the company 50%-50%.</li>
		<li>The author of the idea is usually more important simply because they know the subject better.</li>
		<li>Don't worry about job titles until they are necessary for some practical reason.</li>
		<li>Don't become CEO just because you feel important. The company is at stake, find fitting roles.</li>
		<li>Better split up in two weeks than two months or worse, two years. Ideas can be worked out, personalities
			can't.</li>
		<li>Disputes should not be handled with authority, but measuring. No idea is better than the other unless proven
			so with numbers.</li>
		<li>Put off creating a company until absolutely necessary.</li>
		<li>Never decide on equity without vesting and best if equity is divided when the teams and roles worth is
			clear.</li>
		<li>Profit should be divided amongst all team members, not just owners.</li>
		<li>All team members have a say in all decisions.</li>
		<li>Team members should not have titles or roles, but areas of responsibility (AoR).</li>
		<li>AoR can be changed by self-initiation. One can't just ditch current responsibilities, but moving into a new
			field should be easy.</li>
		<li>All numbers are public between members. Including the most sensitive of them all - ownership, salaries and
			other benefits. Ideally these documents are Pull Request ready.</li>
